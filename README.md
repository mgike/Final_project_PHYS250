# Final_project_PHYS250

This is the source code for Maggie Ke's final project of PHYS 25000 Fall 2024 at the University of Chicago. This project aimed to study the relations between the many-body localization phase transition with the system's interaction graph, boundary conditions and size. Exact diagonalization method was used, which was implemented using the QuTip library in Python.
